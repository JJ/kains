I wasn't able to find a copyright notice for the .eps file, however
I've found:

 - "Kain's symbol [...] was conceived by artist Daniel Cabuco."

 - "This is an EPS (vector) version of Kain's clan symbol for
   high-resolution printing.  It was graciously provided by Amy
   Hennig" http://www.thelostworlds.net/LoKSeries/Symbols.html
